# Google Search Scraper

This Python project scrapes Google search results for specific keywords and extracts both organic search results and "People Also Ask" (PAA) questions. The extracted data is saved in both CSV and JSON formats.

## Features

- **Keyword-Based Search**: Scrapes Google for keywords and retrieves relevant search results.
- **Organic Results Extraction**: Extracts titles and URLs of organic (non-ad) search results.
- **People Also Ask Extraction**: Captures frequently asked questions related to the keyword.
- **CSV and JSON Output**: Saves the extracted data in both CSV and JSON formats.
